            </p><h2>Introduction <a id="intro"></a></h2>
            <p>Our goal is to understand how a potentially large group of participants can be supported to conduct
                collaborative online decision-making processes with a least amount of external governing factors. Since
                there exists a multitude of systems that are regularly used for tasks such as online participation, much
                of the required functionality is well known. This includes mechanisms for proposing an item, discussing
                it and voting on alternatives. However, there is one aspect of collaborative online decision-making that
                is not yet well understood: how can a large group of participants work together to come up with and <em>decide</em>
                on proposals? In real-world politics, there is a vast array of instruments to refine proposals and form
                coalitions in order to reach a final decision. Our idea is to take two of the key underlying elements of
                these instruments and translate them to an online setting. Namely, improving an existing proposal to
                gather more support for it and forming a coalition to join the support of two or more proposals. We
                believe that these elements can be translated to mechanisms that are used for collaborative software
                development through distributed version control systems.</p>
            <p>Based on this idea, we have developed <em>decide</em>, an application for collaborative online
                decision-making that supports the participants to work together to come up with the best possible
                solution for a given issue. This does not require the participants to have homogenous interests and
                agree on a solution. It gives them all the tools they need to come up with good proposals, improve them,
                form coalitions and <em>decide</em> on the result.</p>
            <p>We have conducted several experiments using <em>decide</em>. The results of those experiments are
                encouraging. Participants understand and use the new mechanisms provided for improving and merging
                proposals. Our experiments also suggest that the specific voting system employed may have a significant
                impact on how the participants use the option to improve and merge proposals. This opens a very
                challenging and interesting line of future research.</p>
            <h2>Features of <em>decide</em> <a id="features"></a></h2>
            <p>Our application decide gives participants several ways to participate in a collaborative decision-making
                process. This includes common functions like creating new proposals and commenting on them. What is
                unique, however, is that participants have the possibility to create proposals based on other proposals.
                When creating a new proposal, they are given the choice whether they want to fork (enhance, develop, …)
                or merge (coalition, compromise, …) existing proposals. Forks and merges are ordinary proposals by
                themselves, with the exception that they have relations to their parent proposals. They especially do
                not replace their parents.</p>
            <p>As we want to encourage the participants to collaborate, we decided to use a public, iterative voting <a
                    href='#fn-1' id='fnref1'><sup>1</sup></a> process. It is possible at any time to see how many other
                participants have approved the proposals. This also means that the current forerunner is always visible.
                We believe this is essential for collaboration, because only when participants know the intentions of
                their peers can they meaningfully improve their proposals.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, we support participants at various points in the development of their proposals. For
                example, if a participant´s preferred proposal is not in the lead right now, they get a prompt to look
                for a coalition.</p>
            <h2>Findings from our lab experiments <a id="experiments"></a></h2>
            <p>We tested our idea in two experiments with untrained students. The two processes differed only in their
                voting procedure. In one, participants could only give one approval at a time (plurality voting) and in
                the other, as many as they wanted (approval voting).</p>
            <p>Through the experiments we discovered advantages and disadvantages with both methods. Plurality voting
                was deemed unfair by some participants due to vote splitting—a problem that is amplified with public
                votes. On the other hand, the fact that they could only approve one proposal resulted in a busier
                process. The amount of forking and merging is well visible in the figure below. With plurality voting
                approvals had to be withdrawn as new proposals were introduced. This leads to considerations about older
                approvals participants in the experiment with approval voting did not have to make. In this case,
                significant withdrawals of approvals occurred only shortly before the end of the process in order to
                avoid a draw and ensure victory for the</p>

            <h2>Open research questions <a id="questions"></a></h2>
            <h3>How can we encourage evolution of proposals, while keeping the set of candidate small and relevant?</h3>
            <p>Since we want to encourage change and therefore progress towards better decisions we naturally increase
                the total number of proposals that were made, by a far greater amount than a traditional system that
                allow proposals. As every proposal should be respected, we can not just hide a proposal which has a
                child that may or may not be an improvement for some. How can we determine a relevance for a given
                proposal?</p>
            <h3>How to vote on candidates with relations between them?</h3>
            <p>Imagine you expressed your approval with a certain proposal. Later on you approve a child of that
                proposal. How should your vote be counted? Should we prioritize the vote for a newer proposal, because
                we assume new = better? This may also be important when making a decision with multiple possible winner,
                as in reality proposals that are very closely related are often not suited to be implemented at the same
                time. E.g. <em>Add a slide to the playground</em> and*Add a jungle gym to the playground* may be
                constricted by available space on the playground.</p>
            <h3>How can we help participants find candidates for a coalition?</h3>
            <p>We are already experimenting with <em>similar proposals</em>. Similarity for now is based on the size of
                the shared voters. This can be useful (if not crucial) when trying to settle a decision in a unanimous
                agreement.</p>
