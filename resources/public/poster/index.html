    <h1><i>decide</i> - Support Decision-making through Collaborative Evolution of Proposals</h1>
    <p class="authors">
        <a href="mailto:ebbinghaus@hhu.de">Björn Ebbinghaus</a>
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to improve decision-making in groups by giving participants the tools to improve a set of
            proposals together, without the need of external influence, that puts the participants strictly in the role
            of just a voter.
        </p>
        <p>
            To evaluate our ideas in the field we built a prototype you can find below.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            In an <a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12515.09760/1">experiment in 2019</a> we noticed that
            involved participants in a decision not only want to express their own proposals, but also actively
            participate in the improvement of existing proposals. They used the means available to them to express these
            wishes and (mis)used the discussion function to propose improvements. The problem is that mere comments are
            not the same as proposing a new candidate to vote for.
        </p>

        <p>
            We hope to move from commenting on why a proposal is not good or how it can be improved to creating new and
            improved proposals.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            The idea on which we are building is similar to a version control system in software development, in which
            changes to a code base each have one (or more) predecessors on which they build up on.
            In our case a new proposal can have no, one or many predecessors (parents) and therefore fulfills one of
            these roles:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>1. A proposal with no parents</dt>
            <dd>
                A proposal can be independent.
                This is like the behavior in current systems were a proposal is made without any relationship to
                another proposal.

                <p>
                    Examples: <i>We should build a new playground.</i> Or: <i>We should improve our local
                    parks.</i>
                </p>
            </dd>

            <dt>2. A proposal with exactly one parent (Fork)</dt>
            <dd>
                This represents a proposed change to an existing proposal.
                <p>
                    Example: <i>We should build a new playground <u>with a slide.</u></i> <br>
                    Which is derived from <i>We should build a new playground</i>.
                </p>

            </dd>

            <dt>3. A proposal with more than one parent (Merge)</dt>
            <dd>
                Proposals can also be derived from several predecessors. This can represent a merge of closely
                related proposals or even the formation of a coalition between rivaling proposals.

                <p>
                    Example: <i>We should <u>build a new playground</u> &nbsp;<u>in the park</u></i> <br>
                    Which is a merge of <i>We should build a new playground</i> and <i>We should improve our local
                    parks</i>.
                </p>

            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            We hope to improve the quality and diversity of proposals by focusing on improving proposals.
            In the best case we are definitely trying to achieve — the given tools lead to a single, final merge.
            No need for a vote or similar.
        </p>

        <h2>Open research questions</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How can we encourage evolution of proposals, while keeping the set of candidate small and relevant?
                <p>
                    Since we want to encourage change and therefore progress towards better decisions we
                    naturally increase the total number of proposals that were made, by a far greater amount than a
                    traditional system that allow proposals.
                    As every proposal should be respected, we can not just hide a proposal which has a child that may or
                    may not be an improvement for some.
                    How can we determine a relevance for a given proposal?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                How to vote on candidates with relations between them?
                <p>
                    Imagine you expressed your approval with a certain proposal.
                    Later on you approve a child of that proposal. How should your vote be counted?
                    Should we prioritize the vote for a newer proposal, because we assume new = better?
                    This may also be important when making a decision with multiple possible winner, as in reality
                    proposals that are very closely related are often not suited to be implemented at the same time.
                    E.g. <em>Add a slide to the playground</em> and <em>Add a jungle gym to the playground</em> may be
                    constricted by available space on the playground.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                How can we help participants find candidates for a coalition?
                <p>
                    We are already experimenting with <em>similar proposals</em>. Similarity for now is based on the
                    size of the shared voters. This can be useful (if not crucial) when trying to settle a decision in
                    a unanimous agreement.
                </p>
            </li>

            <!--
                <li>
                    Can we improve the system such that we can (nearly) guarantee a single solution without a vote?
                    <p>

                    </p>
                </li>
            -->
